Hey there!

I wanted to share my thoughts on the **[Garmin Fenix 6x Pro Solar watch reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Charging-features-Grade-Adjusted/dp/B07W69L5KK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestvela0b-20&linkId=e68db56380422bd76c5959578c0c2b39&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. I think it's a great watch for its display, battery life and wilderness GPS tracking capabilities. It isn't for the HIIT athlete unless you're willing to accept some compromises, but it's still a solid choice for outdoor enthusiasts.

The display is always on, which is great for keeping track of time and your current location. The battery life is incredible - I've gone weeks without having to recharge it. And the GPS tracking is very accurate, even in remote areas.

The downside is that the watch is quite bulky and the heart rate monitor is not very

I really like my [**Garmin Fenix 6x Pro-Solar watch**!](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Charging-features-Grade-Adjusted/dp/B07W69L5KK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestvela0b-20&linkId=e68db56380422bd76c5959578c0c2b39&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) The display is fantastic and the battery life is incredible. I've taken it on some long hikes and wilderness camping trips and it's been great for GPS tracking.

However, I would not recommend this watch for HIIT athletes unless you're okay with some compromises. For example, the heart rate monitor is not as accurate as other watches on the market and the watch face is a bit too small for my taste. But overall, it's a great watch and I'm really happy with it.

The **[Garmin Fenix 6x Pro Solar](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Charging-features-Grade-Adjusted/dp/B07W69L5KK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestvela0b-20&linkId=e68db56380422bd76c5959578c0c2b39&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a great watch for those who need a reliable display, long battery life, and robust GPS tracking in the wilderness. While it falls short for HIIT athletes who need more detailed data tracking, the Fenix 6x Pro Solar is still a great option for many people.

I have had my **Garmin fenix 6x pro-solar** for a few months now and I have to say that it is a great watch. The display is fantastic, battery life is incredible, and it does an amazing job of GPS tracking in the wilderness. However, it is not the ideal watch for a HIIT athlete unless you are willing to accept some drawbacks.
